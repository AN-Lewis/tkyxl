**What's your best time-saving shortcut/life hack?**

Here's the basic philosophy of how I work: I sit at my desk for a very long time, no matter how happy or unhappy it makes me, and eventually, the work spools out. I'll get so bored that I'll turn to what I actually need to do. I don't check blogs (except for Romenesko and The Awl, I don't even really know which blogs I like.) I don't have any art around my desk. I'm by a window because I like the sunlight, but I sit with my back to the outdoors. I wish that I used my walking desk (and I'm going to try!), but I'm a little worried the treadmill will make it easier to walk away from my desk. I am not particularly friendly to people who stop by (though I do give myself 30 minutes of social time each afternoon.) I eat lunch at my desk (I get it delivered, and it's the same salad every day.) If I receive an email and it's not obvious why I should respond, I hit delete. (My wife isn't crazy about this last rule.) I go to the bathroom a lot, but besides that, it's not unusual for me to sit at my desk for 8 to 10 hours straight. This is slowly destroying my body—but I would rather write good stuff than be in good shape. 

I want everything in my day to be as boring as possible because it makes all the tasks I need to do the most stimulating options. (And, I should note, many of those are tasks that I genuinely enjoy—I chose to be a reporter because I like the activities themselves.) There are lots of things that might make me more productive (I had a virtual assistant for a while; I once used "The Email Game"), but those productivity aids, I think, pale in comparison to: Sit down. Don't get up. Don't do anything at work that doesn't involve work. If you do that enough days in a row, it becomes second nature.


**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

The best advice I received wasn't really advice, but the example of other people's decisions. I'm inspired by people who continue working—hard and painfully, on things that are important to them, but not necessarily the fastest paths to glory —when they don't need to, or when fame or leisure are plausible alternatives. Michael Lewis could hang up his reporter's notebook and, for the rest of his life, be lauded as one of the greatest living writers. But he continues doing important work.

In college, I took a course from David Brion Davis, who by the time I encountered him had already won the Pulitzer Prize and had, in important ways, redefined our sense of both historical research and slavery. He taught every class as if something depended upon him being as good and clear as possible. He was in his late 60's, but I saw him once on the street and he blew past us, walking fast and hard, with no time to waste. That is the example I hope to emulate, and the best advice I've received.

**Is there anything else you want to add?**

Productivity, I think, isn't about the apps you use or the way you create a to-do list or some new gadget. (Though, that said, I read interviews like this all the time, hopeful they will reveal some new app or to-do list or gadget that will change my life.) 12P
Problems regarding organizing tasks or lives are relatively easy to solve—and, if you're working hard and smart, I think, the solutions change depending on your project or stage of life or how you feel that day. Productivity isn't one shift, any more than love is one emotion or meaningfulness one moment.

Rather, I think productivity is about the story you tell yourself about yourself and the world. To-do lists work when they reinforce —and mature—the mental models we carry around that make it easier to, say, think about a paragraph on the subway and see some deep structural problem; or become fully immersed in a task because you know you'll have a way to recover once the task is done.

Productivity is, ultimately, about thinking more deeply. And the best productivity aids, in my experience, are things that push me to critique ideas until they become more true and real. Sometimes that's an editor or a friend. Sometimes it's a walk or a run. At other periods it's simply hard, good, frustrating and mind-numbing self-criticism, in front of a screen or manuscript, reading the same paragraphs over and over (or avoiding reading them) until the deep truths or logical fallacies or opportunities for creativity become clear.

I've been really lucky in life—luckier, frankly, than I deserve. When I labor to deserve that good fortune it seems to create more productivity in my life. And so I try to honor that luck and prove that I'm worthy in how I behave and think, and I'm grateful for the productivity that occurs.
