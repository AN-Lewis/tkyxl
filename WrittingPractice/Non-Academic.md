Although dozens of studies suggest that research-based self-help can provide real benefits—in particular, for anxiety, depression and drug addiction—more than 95 percent of self-help books and programs have never been subjected to scientific scrutiny, according to John C. Norcross, a professor of psychology at the University of Scranton and co-author of Self-Help That Works (Oxford University Press, 2013). 

What, then, are the critical elements of good self-help programs? **First, overcoming depression, anxiety, addictions or other disorders typically requires learning new coping skills over many months or years, not in a matter of days or weeks. This is why successful forms of self-help prepare one for a long period of self-improvement and why groups like AA suggest long-term attendance. Intense, one-time experiences typically do not provide the ongoing support needed for lasting change.**

Second, good programs have independent data showing their effectiveness, not just anecdotes, and they are generally adapted from techniques shown to work in more conventional therapy administered by professionals. If there is no published literature supporting a program—no matter how popular it may be— that is a red flag.

**[The War Over Poverty](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/opinion/krugman-the-war-over-poverty.html)**

Fifty years have passed since Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. And a funny thing happened on the way to this anniversary. Suddenly, or so it seems, progressives have stopped apologizing for their efforts on behalf of the poor, and have started trumpeting them instead. And conservatives find themselves on the defensive.

**It wasn’t supposed to be this way. For a long time, everyone knew — or, more accurately, “knew” — that the war on poverty had been an abject failure. And they knew why: It was the fault of the poor themselves. But what everyone knew wasn’t true, and the public seems to have caught on.**

The narrative went like this: Antipoverty programs hadn’t actually reduced poverty, because poverty in America was basically a social problem — a problem of broken families, crime and a culture of dependence that was only reinforced by government aid. And because this narrative was so widely accepted, bashing the poor was good politics, enthusiastically embraced by Republicans and some Democrats, too.

Yet this view of poverty, which may have had some truth to it in the 1970s, bears no resemblance to anything that has happened since.

For one thing, the war on poverty has, in fact, achieved quite a lot. It’s true that the standard measure of poverty hasn’t fallen much. But this measure doesn’t include the value of crucial public programs like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit. Once these programs are taken into account, the data show a significant decline in poverty, and a much larger decline in extreme poverty. Other evidence also points to a big improvement in the lives of America’s poor: lower-income Americans are much healthier and better-nourished than they were in the 1960s.

**Furthermore, there is strong evidence that antipoverty programs have long-term benefits, both to their recipients and to the nation as a whole.** For example, children who had access to food stamps were healthier and had higher incomes in later life than people who didn’t.



**[Why Not a Three-Day Week?](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/three-day-week)**

In 1930, John Maynard Keynes posed a question about the economic future of society:  

“What can we reasonably expect the level of our economic life to be, a hundred years hence?
What are the economic possibilities for our grandchildren?” 

**To Keynes, the answer was clear: the rapid accumulation of capital, combined with technological advances, had already, by his estimates, improved the average quality of life in the West fourfold since the Industrial Revolution, and there was no reason why that trend shouldn’t continue.**


“I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is to-day,” he wrote. The potent combination of technology and capital would render most material-based concerns irrelevant; people would no longer have to worry about basic problems of survival. One result would be an unprecedented abundance of leisure time, which would present a new problem for the average human: “How to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”


**From quora**

Being a writer isn't just about writing. It's a lot of hard work, and much of that work has little to do with writing.

What do I mean by "a lot"? I'll explain from my background, which is writing fiction. Other writers will have other things to say about technical writing, freelance, etc.

Yes, some days I sit at a coffee shop and tinker away at my keyboard, knocking off a solid few chapters and having a jolly good time. That's when I'm feeling the groove of a story, and I can just let my fingers fly. That's the fun part. 

After the fun part--writing--there's primary editing. This doesn't just go to an editor; it's not work to pass off. No, the writer sits down, and edits. I usually go through each manuscript at least twice. Slowly. She cuts, slashes, burns whole chapters. I shoot to kill at least 20% of any book or story pre-publishing. Editing is boring, hard work, and you have to be sober to do it. I'll catch whole chapters that don't make sense because I didn't foreshadow enough back in chapter one. Or I'll realize I changed a character's name halfway through.

After the editing, there's the testing. Beta-readers--trusted friends, avid fans, and fellow writers--read the book and offer critique. They'll catch the stuff you missed. One of mine, for my last book, totally saved my ass because I'd had my characters discuss Duke football with a passion. (This also inspired the question: Is Duke University more well known for their football or basketball?)

Before, during, or after the beta-reading phase, a writer will typically send the manuscript to a hired editor.

After that, there's the final reviews. The writer sits down and reads through the critiques. He fixes holes in the plot, he makes the protagonist more likable, or the antagonist more of a bitch. He cuts back on the swearing because half the beta-group was "offended" (whilst cursing the goddamn beta readers for being such pansies, though he'll certainly send them glowing thank-you notes, and maybe a giftcard or some show of gratitude, in a few weeks/months). I've given up on a full length novel because of beta-feedback. That, friends, really fucking hurts. But it was useful! 

Depending on the author, there is also discussion with agents, editors, and publishing houses during all of this. I self-publish, so I skip that nonsense. 

During the process, the self-publisher needs to hire a cover artist, or buy a pre-made cover. Some also hire a person to help with formatting.

During the process, the writer is also tweeting, blogging, facebooking, and actively keeping up with forums online. She's promoting, she's encouraging other writers, she's offering critiques and help when she can. She's interacting with fans (that part is fun!) and haters. She's planning the release of her next book, how to promote it, who she can ask for some initial good reviews, etc.

Then, the book is published. 

So, this all probably sounds a little like I hate being a writer. Yet, as much as I can bitch and whine about how much more money I'd be making if I just went and got a damn day job, having a fan write me to ask when the next book is coming out, or just to say they really loved the last one, is a thrill. An absolute thrill. These people aren't my friends and family. They're not obligated to say nice things to me. Yet they do, and it makes all the misery almost worth it.

The other great thing about being a writer is that the fun parts are fantastic. It's a passion, it overtakes me...when I'm deep in a book, I'm sometimes not a very good conversationalist. This isn't a job I go home from. I don't put my notebook/computer away at the end of my workday and forget about my stories. I'm constantly thinking about my characters. I meet a girl and see the way her dyed hair makes her eyes pop, and I wonder if I can slip that into the story I'm working on. I listen to discussions around me and think about the dynamics of dialog. I'm making notes, always thinking. I suppose this obsession is both good and bad. Part of the work, part of the fun.

The respect from peers is pretty awesome, too. A lot of people have this fantasy impression of authors, sitting with their coffees or teas or wines, clicking away at their laptops, their pretty little heads spinning tales...But sometimes it gets a little annoying because people don't really get how much work it is. Some do, some don't. If I take the time to explain it, they understand a little more, but being a writer is one of those things you really have to experience to fully understand.

Communication is a cornerstone of science. Writing research grants and papers, and oral presentation of talks, along with debates, negotiations, and community building are essential skills. Yet, science communication skills are rarely learned formally, making their acquisition a matter of circumstance and chance. How unscientific!   

A core mission of the BSI Director’s Office is supporting researchers’ communication activities. This includes professional consulting and editing of manuscripts and grants, presentation coaching, scientific networks and collaborations, advocacy to the government and funding agencies, and public/media outreach and education.

This Summer Program Open Lab is a collaboration between the BSI Director’s Office and the Postdoctoral Fellow Association (PDFA). We will outline present and future perspectives on science communication in research and career development. Please come for a drink and snack and be prepared to exercise your communication skills!
